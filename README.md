# Pytorch_Autoencoder
Encoder from scratch using pytorch

See https://youtu.be/oF7MYjQv1zA for walkthrough of code and results of testing autoencoder code.

Plan was to apply to spatial transcriptomic gene expression from CosMx SMI clear cell renal cell carcinoma. However, the results compressed ~30% of genes to zero, while keeping some (like immune cell markers) very well in the reconstruction of the gene expression. Further testing is ongoing.
